title: Sanguine - a Ruby roguelike game
category: post
---

After being distracted writing a C# client for LCoG I finally had time away (not to mention limited distractions) to restart development on my roguelike game. I've written it in Ruby and instead of using the traditional Ncurses approach for the UI I've opted for a tile-based implementation using the fantastic libgosu.
