title: Rubmorph - Biomorphs in the land of Ruby
---

I was playing around with Ruby using the [Gosu graphics library](http://www.libgosu.org/) a few weeks ago whilst waiting for our internet connection to be sorted and ended up kocking together a biomorph implementation in about 200 lines of code (and that was me being verbose, gotta love Ruby).

Biomorphs are virtual creatures as described by Richard Dawkins in his book [The Blind Watchmaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker). I guess the point is to show how relative complexity can develop from simplicity in surprising ways using a few simple rules.

The Rubymorph script can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sal1n/rubymorph).

Here is a quick example of the sort of thing it can generate:
