title: Pity this busy monster..

"pity this busy monster, manunkind,

not. Progress is a comfortable disease:
your victim (death and life safely beyond)

plays with the bigness of his littleness
— electrons deify one razorblade
into a mountainrange; lenses extend
unwish through curving wherewhen till
unwish returns on its unself.

A world of made
is not a world of born — pity poor flesh

and trees, poor stars and stones, but never
this fine specimen of hypermagical

ultraomnipotence. We doctors know

a hopeless case if — listen: there’s a hell
of a good universe next door; let’s go"

**~ E. E. Cummings**
